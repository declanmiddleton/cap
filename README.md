Description & Purpose

CAP (Comprehensive Assessment Platform) is a modern, Rust-based security assessment and orchestration framework designed for authorized penetration testing, defensive research, and security training.

CAP provides a unified interface for reconnaissance, session handling, and controlled shell interaction, with a strong emphasis on scope enforcement, auditability, and operational safety.
Unlike traditional C2 frameworks, CAP is intentionally opinionated: all actions are scoped, logged, and attributable.

The framework is suitable for use during authorized post-exploitation phases, controlled red team engagements, blue team validation, lab environments, and educational use cases.

CAP is built from the ground up in Rust, prioritizing memory safety, performance, and transparency, while still offering the practical ergonomics expected from modern security tooling.

What CAP Is (and Is Not)

CAP is:
- A security assessment framework
- A controlled shell listener
- A reconnaissance and enumeration orchestrator
- A research and training framework
- An exploitation toolkit

CAP is not:
- A malware framework
  
Typical scenarios include:
- Authorized penetration tests
- Red team reconnaissance and post-exploitation
- Security research and tool development
- CTFs and lab environments
